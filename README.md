# Overview
A **Tampermonkey** userscript for Google Calendar that simply removes **Birthdays** and **Tasks** from **My calendars** to free up that valuable space for all of your exciting PTO and team meeting calendars.

It does this seamlessly and efficiently, only when the elements are redrawn or updated.

# To Install
- Make sure you have the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension installed, enabled, and the **Allow User Scripts** permission checked in its **Manage Extension** view.
- Open the raw script from this repo: [/JohannesMP/HideHardcodedGoogleCalendars/raw/refs/heads/main/HideHardcodedGoogleCalendars.user.js](https://github.com/JohannesMP/HideHardcodedGoogleCalendars/raw/refs/heads/main/HideHardcodedGoogleCalendars.user.js)
    - If you have Tampermonkey enabled it should prompt you to install the script:

    - Alternatively you can past the script raw URL into the 'Import from URL' field in Tampermonkey's [Utilities tab](chrome-extension://dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/options.html#nav=utils):
